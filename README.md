# Candidus Lite Ghost Theme

Candidus Lite is an Open-Source theme for the Ghost CMS. It is built to be simple and fast, without making any comprimise in terms of user - and dev experience.

## The idea behind the project

I wanted to create a Ghost theme which has little overhead and feels like you're reading your favorite book or magazine on your phone. The reader should easily move between different parts of the blog without actively searching for navigation elements.

That is also how the theme's files are structured. Every module has its dedicated place, from where it is bundled into a single Javascript file with the others when building.

Candidus translates to *clean* or *bright*. Compared to Google's Material design, it does not use a variety of grids or lighting, but only a few chosen core colors and layout styles.

## Demo

I did not create a dedicated demo page yet, but actively use it on my personal blog:
